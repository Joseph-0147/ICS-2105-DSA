It is not possible to solve the problem of finding the starting node of a cycle in a linked list using O(1) space complexity. 
This is because finding the cycle start requires identifying a specific node within the cycle. 
This inherently involves traversing the linked list and potentially comparing node pointers.
Constant space O(1) wouldn't allow for storing additional information about visited nodes or maintaining pointers for comparison.
